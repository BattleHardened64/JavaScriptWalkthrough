            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I am a Junior computer science major and mathematics minor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. 
               However, I am always excited to look for new opportunities working on side projects and taking
               on new challenges. I am most comfortable with C++, Java, and ARM Assembly, however I have dabbled in 
               many languages including C, C#, Javascript, HTML and CSS.  I am currently expanding my knowledge in 
               the latter 3 languages to make myself a more well-rounded developer.
            </p>
            <h1>What am I looking to do in the future?</h1>
            <p>
                I am open to most software development industries, however I have a much deeper interest 
                in space and defense. I have considered contracting to gain experience, but I am 
                definitely looking for a stable job over a contract.
            </p>
            <h1>What experience do I have?</h1>
            <p>
                I have experience in the Space sector at Northrop Grumman working on SharePoint design and 
                managing pages as a site owner for the MDS section of Space. I have team experience through
                a few class projects and as vice president of ACM I am constantly helping lead the team.
            </p>
            <h1>What are my hobbies?</h1>
            <p>
                I have many hobbies, currently I am an active member of fencing club, I do mountain biking,
                I enjoy reading, playing video games, and cooking.  If you have any similar interests and 
                want to talk about them please reach out to me! I'm always excited to meet new people!
